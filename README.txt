Game is based off an episode of a popular netflix show Squid Game where the player must cross a bridge and decide
between the left or right tile. It could either hold their weight or they plummet to the ground to their death.
The contestent must remember which tile the player in front of them stepped on that was safe.

Important Notes:
- Must have all png images downloaded in order to run the game.

General notes:
- Left arrow picks left tile
- Right arrow picks right tile
- DO NOT SPAM THE KEYS OR HOLD DOWN THE ARROW KEYS!!!!!!! 
- keyboard can be sticky so sometimes you might hit the arrow once but it will bug out and move twice in a row. 
This only happens occasionally however.
